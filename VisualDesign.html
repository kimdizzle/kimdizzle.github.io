	<h2> This is my mandala</h2>

	<h3>The original shape I had was a palm tree and I chose this shape because it reminds me of Florida and how warm it is over there, in comparison to how cold it is in NYC. The first color I chose was green to represent the color of the palm trees. Throughout the process I decided to change the colors to purple, pink, and blue because I wanted it to look like a rainbow. I later added a drop shadow to help enhance the illusion of the mandala. The process of making this shape into a mandala was very time consuming and tedious because I had to repeat the same steps at least 6 times. I had to merge, duplicate, scale, center, rotate, and then repeat. It was not hard, but it was amazing to see the end result, hence it being my first time creating a mandala. </h3>
	<h2> This is my kaleidoscope </h2>

	<h3>The original photo I chose was baked macaroni and cheese because the thanksgiving holiday is coming up and that is my favorite thing to eat. I decided to add filters to it, because I wanted to distort the image in a way. The purpose of distorting the image is to make it unrecognizable and it makes the art more fun to look at. The process of turning this artwork into a kaleidoscope was extremely tedious because I had to copy and paste the same photo at least eight times. But the end product came out great as you can see!
